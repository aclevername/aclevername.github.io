Hi, my names Jake Klein. I'm a software developer working at [Syntasso](https://syntasso.io). I've previously worked at:

- [WeaveWorks](https://www.google.com/search?q=weaveworks&oq=weaveworks&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqCggAEAAY4wIYgAQyCggAEAAY4wIYgAQyDQgBEC4YrwEYxwEYgAQyBwgCEAAYgAQyBwgDEAAYgAQyBwgEEAAYgAQyBwgFEAAYgAQyBwgGEAAYgAQyBwgHEAAYgAQyBwgIEAAYgAQyBwgJEAAYgATSAQc5MzZqMGo3qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) as a developer of its (now defunct) enterprise [Flux](https://fluxcd.io) wrapper and as a maintainer of [eksctl](https://github.com/eksctl-io/eksctl), an OSS(ish) tool for managing EKS clusters.
- Pivotal (and VMWare through acquistion) as developer, working on its [Redis Broker](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/cf-redis-broker) and its backup tooling [Bosh Backup and Restore (BBR)](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-backup-and-restore) 

The majority of the projects I've worked on have been in Golang and have primarily in the CNCF world, with a focus on Kubernetes.
